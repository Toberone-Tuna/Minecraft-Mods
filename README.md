# Minecraft-Mods
Go to a different branch (drop-down menu on the top left) to select the mod collection you want.

After that, go to Code>Download ZIP to get a zipped file with the folder of mods inside of it. (The mods folder ITSELF that the mods are in should be in the same folder as a README.md file)
