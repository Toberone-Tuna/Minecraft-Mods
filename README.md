# Minecraft 1.12.2 Custom Galacticraft Mods V2

Mods for custom 1.12.2 Galacticraft modded world version 2.

To download, go to Code>Download ZIP to get a zipped file with the folder of mods inside of it. (The mods folder ITSELF that the mods are in should be in the same folder as a README.md file)

The 'Flan' folder itself should be in the main '.minecraft' folder, while all of the mods go into the 'mods' folder.

Don't forget to put the files inside the 'config' folder into your 'config' folder.

**Requires:** Java 8 (Windows Offline 64-Bit), Found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) (Computer restart required after installing)

**Minecraft Version:** Forge 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2860, Found [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)

**Note:** I highly recommend allocating 8GB of RAM to Minecraft when using these mods.

**Known Issues:**

-Buying certain items on MineBay on the computer from MrCrayfish's Furniture mod crashes the server.

-Certain sounds are cut short and/or cut off when in the Twilight Forest dimension.

-The Midnight mod has an error that VanillaFix catches and will constantly spam to the log.

-Wearing the special 3d-model armor from the SCP:Lockdown mod (Arrowproof Vest, Hazmat Suit, NightVision Goggles, etc.) causes a MASSIVE memory leak and framerate issues that will eventually make the game unplayable and the only way to fix it is restarting the game and never wearing the armor.
